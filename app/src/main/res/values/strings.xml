    <string name="text1">How does it work?</string>
    <string name="text2">KPI Money Rewards is an app that lets you redeem prizes such as gift cards, discounts and vouchers by earning points through the KPI Money Rewards Android App (iOS app coming soon).\nOur app offers various methods to earn points such as by completing offers, downloading and playing games, answering surveys and even by watching TV (multiple channels are available).\nAfter earning points, you are able to use your points to redeem for our selection of gift cards and vouchers. These rewards includes gift cards from PayPal, Amazon, Play Store, XBox Store and Play Station Network Store.</string>
    <string name="text3">Will I get my reward?</string>
    <string name="text4">Yes you will.\nRewards generally arrive between 1 weeks and may be delayed longer depending on stock or volume issues (all reward processing is done manually by our staff).\nHowever, you can be rest assured that you will get your reward, even if it may sometimes arrive a little later than expected.</string>
    <string name="text5">What is the proper way to start an offer?</string>
    <string name="text6">Ensure that you started the offer correctly.The proper steps are:\n\nStep 1: Click Offer Get Offer button.\nStep 2: Download the app when the Play Store page for the app opens\nStep 3: Launch the downloaded app\nStep 4: Complete the offer requirements\n\nAttempting to start an offer without following these steps may result in the offers tracking to not work properly and may cause missing points.\nPlease also note that this app should only be used on 1 device at a time only. Using KPI Money Rewards on multiple devices simultaneously may cause you to not receive points.</string>
    <string name="text7">I completed an offer but did not receive my points?</string>
    <string name="text8">If you encounter such a situation, please double check the following:</string>
    <string name="text9">1. Check if you completed the offers requirements correctly.</string>
    <string name="text10">For example:\n- If an offer requires you to Download, install and explore, this means that you should ensure that you have downloaded the app, opened it and explored the app for at least 2.5 minutes.\n- If an offer requires you to Complete Level 11, this means that you should finish level 11 and be at level 12 or above.\n- If an offer requires you to Reach Level 20, this means that you should be at level 20 or above.\n- If an offer requires you to Complete your profile / registration, this means that you should complete your personal profile on the app/website.\n- If an offer requires you to Make a purchase, this means that you should make a valid purchase. A trial is most of the time not considered a valid purchase.\n</string>
    <string name="text11">2. Ensure that you are not using VPN or Ad-blockers.</string>
    <string name="text12">\n3. Ensure that you started the offer correctly. The proper steps are:</string>
    <string name="text13">Step 1: Click Offers Get Offer button.\nStep 2: Download the app when the Play Store page for the app opens.\nStep 3: Launch the app.\nStep 4: Complete the offers requirements.\n Attempting to start an offer without following these steps may result in the offers tracking to not work properly and may cause missing points.</string>
    <string name="text14">\n4. Ensure that you were indeed a New User.</string>
    <string name="text15">Most offers require you to be a New User. If you had installed the app on your current device in the past, even if you have uninstalled it, you are still not considered a New User. If the offer requires you to be a new user, then you will only receive points if you are truly a new user.\n</string>
